  If you have a spam filter, you’re already using text categorization 
  every day. More advanced applications are able to recognize topics
  such as politics, football or music with very high precision. For example,
  if you’re a media company, you can use these methods 
  to alert users about new content on
  topics they’re really interested in, or you can customize the content
  of your website and search results to your customers’ personal profiles.
