  Thesauri are the foundation for many Information Retrieval systems. 
  Search engines, for example, extend the queries of their users by 
  adding synonyms and related keywords. In my PhD dissertation, I explored
  novel ways of automatically discovering such words with similar meanings,
  even across dialects and different languages. The output of these methods
  can harness Information Retrieval systems against language variation 
  in their text collections.
