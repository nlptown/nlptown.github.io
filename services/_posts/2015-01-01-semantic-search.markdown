  These days users expect more from a search engine than a system that simply 
  returns a list of documents with the words they typed in. Through a 
  careful application of Natural Language Processing, modern search engines aim to truly
  understand the needs of their users. They scan their text collection for synonyms, 
  learn the topics of a text, or identify entities such as people and places and
  discover the relations between them. In these ways, they extract
  the information present in their documents, and present it to their users in 
  novel ways.
