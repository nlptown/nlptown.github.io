  There is more to Machine Translation than Google Translate. 
  I have extensive experience training and optimizing 
  state-of-the-art MT systems such as 
  <a href="www.statmt.org/moses/">Moses</a> and 
  <a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu/phrasal/">Phrasal</a>, 
  which allow companies to build customized translation solutions. 
  By training these systems on their own texts or those of their 
  customers, companies can achieve far superior performance and 
  bring down translation effort and cost.
