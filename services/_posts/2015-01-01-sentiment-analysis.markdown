  Thanks to the popularity of blogs, social media, 
  and review sites, more and more people are making themselves heard. 
  Your users and customers write reviews of your products on their blogs,
  or share their opinion about your company on Twitter. 
  Sentiment Analysis identifies the feelings behind these messages: 
  it classifies them as positive or negative, or detects emotions
  such as anger and joy. It allows you to know your customers
  better and to respond to their needs more successfully.
