  Information Extraction is the task of identifying useful information in
  unstructured documents. In the past I have developed methods
  for finding definitions of terms in legislation, for identifying entities
  (people, organizations, locations) and the relations between them, and 
  for transforming job ads and CVs to structured tables whose values can
  be matched. In this way, Natural Language Processing helps turn large
  collections of unstructured text into actionable insights.
