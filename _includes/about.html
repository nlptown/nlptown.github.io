                    <p>Text contains a wealth of information, but it mostly comes in unstructured form.
			In this age of
                        unprecedented data growth, more and more companies are turning to 
			Natural Language Processing to make sense of their
                        textual data or to interact with their clients in new and exciting ways.
                        NLP helps them determine the topics that are covered in a text, the people and places
                        that are mentioned, the sentiment that is expressed, and so on.
