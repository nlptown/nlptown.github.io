                        useful information in unstructured documents. Depending on your task, 
			this information can vary from entities
			(such as people, organizations and locations) in newspaper articles,
			to definitions in legislation, career information in CVs or 
 			judgments in court proceedings. Whenever
			information is expressed in a consistent manner, we can develop methods
			to find it automatically.</p>

			Text categorization is at the heart of many tools that have become
			indispensable to our lives.
                        E-mail software uses spam filters to distinguish between useful e-mails
                        and spam, media organizations rely on computational semantics to detect the topics
                        of news articles, and customer-centric companies apply sentiment analysis
                        to tweets and reviews to determine what their customers are cheering or 
                        complaining about.</p>

                    <p class="text-muted">
  			Today users expect more from a search engine than a system that simply
  			returns a list of documents with the words they typed in. 
  			Modern search engines scan their text collection for synonyms,
  			learn the topics in all texts, or identify entities and the relations between them. 
			In this way they aim to truly understand the needs of their users, and 
			present them with more relevant and personalized search results.</p>
