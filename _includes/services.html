                          in unstructured form. Natural Language Processing offers a variety of methods to extract 
                          this information: it helps us determine the topics that are covered in a text, the people 
                          and places that are mentioned, the sentiment that is expressed, and so on. If you would like 
                          to analyze your textual data and turn it into practical insight, youâ€™ve come to the right place.</h3>

                        useful information in unstructured documents &mdash; definitions of
                        terms in legislations, entities (people, organizations, locations) in 
                        newspaper articles, career information in CVs, etc. If it is there, 
                        we can develop methods to find it.</p>

			Text categorization is at the heart of many indispensible tools today.
                        E-mail software uses spam filters to distinguish between useful e-mails
                        and spam, media organizations rely on semantic models to detect the topics
                        of news articles, and customer-centric companies apply sentiment analysis
                        to tweets and reviews to determine what their customers are happy or 
                        unhappy about.</p>

  			These days users expect more from a search engine than a system that simply
  			returns a list of documents with the words they typed in. Through a
  			careful application of Natural Language Processing, modern search engines aim to tru$
  			understand the needs of their users. They scan their text collection for synonyms,
  			learn the topics of a text, or identify entities such as people and places and
  			discover the relations between them. In these ways, they extract
  			the information present in their documents, and present it to their users in
			novel ways.</p>
